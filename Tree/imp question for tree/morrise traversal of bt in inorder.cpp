//Self notes:
//In-order Morris Traversal:
//ðŸŒ³ 1st case: if left is null, print current node and go right
//ðŸŒ³ 2nd case: before going left, make right most node on left subtree connected to current node, then go left
//ðŸŒ³ 3rd case: if thread is already pointed to current node, then remove the thread ...


//for recusive  as well as itreative the tc=o(n) and sc o(n).. 
//but  for morrise traversal it will be  tc=o(n) and sc o(1).. 
// morris traversal works in  threds tree
